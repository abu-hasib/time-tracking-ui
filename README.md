## My process

I went with the vanilla way. Even though it took longer but it was worth it. I got to play around with different way doing things.

I followed these steps but still overlapped as time went by.

    Fleshed out the html
    Wrote the styles
    Added interactivity

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
